## Project Documentation: Frontier-Crew AI 

### Overview
This repository contains several mini-games developed using the `pygame` library. Each game is located in the `./pygame` folder and can be run individually using Python. The games explore different concepts ranging from memory tasks to reflex-based challenges. This documentation provides installation instructions, game descriptions, and usage details.

### Installation
Before running the games, ensure that `pygame` is installed in your environment. You can install `pygame` using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

# Running the Games
Each game is located under the `./pygame` folder. To run a specific game, use Python to execute the respective script. Below are the commands to run each game:

1. **Fractal N-Back Game**  
A memory challenge where players need to recall fractal patterns at varying levels of difficulty.

**Run the game:**

```bash
python3 ./pygame/fractal_n_back.py
```
2. **Words Group Classification Game**  
A language-based task where players classify words into different groups based on certain rules.

**Run the game:**

```bash
python3 ./pygame/words_group_classification.py
```

3. **Red-Green Balloon Reflex Game**  
A reflex-testing game where players must respond to red or green balloons as quickly as possible.

**Run the game:**

```bash
python3 ./pygame/red_green_baloon_reflex.py
```

4. **Catapult Code Game**  
A physics-based game where players control a catapult to hit a target by adjusting power and angle.

**Run the game:**

```bash
python3 ./pygame/catapult_code.py
```

5. **Space on Maze Game**

Visit [MazeSuite](https://mazesuite.com/) to install the software.

After installation, open the project file located at `./space_on_maze/Maze6.maz` and run the game using the MazeSuite program.
